# TODO

### FOR... GUI SEARCH AND LAUNCH

* Implement ability to track when files were last modified on **your** machine. We could then give a summary of what you might be 'rusty' on.

### FOR... PROBLEMS

* Document and Explain all code exercises that don't have it.
* We want to include all the CodeJam problems. There are a lot of them so we need either a lot of time, or a scraping solution. So investigate a scraping solution for CodeJam past problems.
