# Fizz Buzz

Write a program that prints the numbers within a range `start` to `end`, or alternatively returns the values in a `list`. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

The number `33` would be `'Fizz'`, the number `30` (**3** x **5** x 2) would be `'Fizzbuzz'`.

```
fizzbuzz( 10, 18 ) # > "Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16 17 Fizz"
# Alternatively
fizzbuzz( 4, 10 ) # > [4, 'Buzz', 6, 7, 8, 'Fizz', 'Buzz']
```
