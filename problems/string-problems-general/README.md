# General String Problems

### String Reverse

Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print it in reverse order.

```
str_reverse( "string" ) # "gnirts"
```

### Even index characters

Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print the characters that have even indexes.

```
even_index_chars( "H1e2l3l4o5w6o7r8l9d" ) # "Helloworld"
```
