# Full Justification [HARD]

Given a single-line text String and a maximum width value, write the function 'String justify(String text, int maxWidth)' that formats the input text using full-justification, i.e., extra spaces on each line are equally distributed between the words; the first word on each line is flushed left and the last word on each line is flushed right.

```python
full_justification("Justify this sentence." , 40) # > "Justify   this   sentence."
```
